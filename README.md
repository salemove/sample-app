# Using SaleMove APIs

Welcome!

The code examples are separated into different branches of this
repository:
- Branch [`getting_started`][1] includes examples from the post [Getting
  Started with SaleMove][2]

In each of these branches, the interesting code is in `index.html`,
`sample.js`, and `sample.css` files.

Happy exploring!
